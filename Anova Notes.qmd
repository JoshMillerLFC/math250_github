Idea: Compare the variability of the observed group means, x1, x2, ..., xk with the variability within the group. Then we compute an F-Statistic and get a p-value, a low p value represents evidence against the null hypothesis (H0), p-value is the probability that we get data similar to what we got through random chance. 

Anova: H0: all group means are the same H1 = H2 = ... = Hk
       Ha: At least one group mean is not the same
       
To do an Anova we need a categorical and numerical:

1. State the hypotheses
2. Visualization
3. Run the test: `aov()`
4. State a conclusion in ordinary human language
5. Consider which groups might be different

Assumptions of Anova:

1. Observations are independent of each other
2. In each group the quantitative variable is normally-distributed (can be broken especially for large samples)
3. The variance or STD in each group should be the same (can be broken for large samples)
